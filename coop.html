                <h1 class="md">First Co-op: WSP</h1>
                <p>
                    During my time at WSP, I was able to work on a wide range of projects. I was in a client facing role, which allowed me to develop 
                    my communication skills as well as learn how to interact with clients and deal with any issues that arose. <br/><br/>

                    My range of projects included retail infrastructure, land development and trail works projects. I was assigned to help manage over 10 projects
                    at a time with my team which improved my time management skills. <br/><br/>

                    The most enjoyable part of this term is when I was given the opportunity to advise clients on the financial side of projects. I was able to
                    advise clients on potential partnerships and do this by developing excel spreadsheets with analysis I had done on project financing. <br/><br/>

                    I learned a lot of things on this co-op and I think these can be summed up in the following 10 points. <br/>
                    1. Contracts are never executed the way they're drawn up. Things are different on paper than in real life. Consulting firms need to be ready to make 
                    adjustments to help the project go smoothly for the client. <br/>
                    2. Subcontractors and general contractors both think they’re always correct. This can be a major
                    downfall and lead to mistakes and conflicts. <br/>
                    3. The devil is in the details. Know contracts well, so that financials can be managed appropriately.  <br/>
                    4. Trust must be earned, and never given. People must prove that they can be trusted, there are
                    people that will try and take shortcuts when they get the opportunity. <br/>
                    5. Uniform leadership is a must for all infrastructure projects. Things fall apart as different parts of
                    projects are managed by different people who aren’t on the same page. <br/>
                    6. Put technical experts in positions where they can apply their skills and be successful. Allow them
                    to do what they do best and not worry about managing a project. <br/>
                    7. Behavioral patterns will emerge from people over time. These can indicate what type of
                    business decisions people will make, and the intent behind those decisions.<br/>
                    8. Micromanagement can frustrate workers. Put people in positions to succeed, and they won’t
                    need to be managed on such a delicate level. <br/>
                    9. Project engineers are often at odds with contractors. These relationships should be carefully
                    maintained. <br/>
                    10. City officials and administrators have a lot of power. Always keep these types of stakeholders up
                    to date on projects and keep them in the loop. <br/>

                <p>
                    In this role as a Project Coordinator, I was focused on the rehabilitation of the Ashbridges Bay Water Treatment Plant in Toronto.
                    As someone who is interested in Water Resources, I was excited to work on this project. This co-op allowed me to see the build process
                    for a major infrastructure project. There were many stakeholders on this project which increased the complexity of the work
                    and the project management process.

                <p>
                    I was a Finance and Risk Intern at the Ministry of Finance before going to the University of Waterloo. Within this role I was able to 
                    diversify the work I did to gain a number of different skills. <br/><br/>
                    One of my main tasks was to increase the efficienty of analysts by building templates in Microsoft Excel that would automatically evaluate
                    tax amounts. Another way that I increased efficiency was by building scripts in Visual Basic that would complete repetitive tasks that
                    were previously being done manually. This saved a lot of time for analysts as they completed tax assessments.  <br/><br/>
                    I was also able to help work on an specialized audit in the mining sector. I worked on this project with a team and was able to 
                    help present findings to a Senior Manager. This allowed me to see what goes on in an audit which was a great experience for me.
